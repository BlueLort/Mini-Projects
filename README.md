#### This Repository Contains some of Mini-Projects i made during free time 
You may try any project using the executable file i left in the folder of the project instead of building the entire project(if you dont want to see the code).
# List

## Java Paint
   - Paint Software using JavaFX.
   - Goal was to get used to some design patterns (like MVC,factory,Singleton..)
   - This project was for College so i did not do it alone so i have to mention my friends: 
     - Sherif(sherifovic)
     - Mohamed(harraz21)
   - Unfortunately this project has some bugs(undo&redo) due to short time developing it during college.

## Serial Reader
   - Goal was to make a software that reads from Arduino(certain formatting input).
   - That Application is not yet complete like Reading camera frames as this project was to help us in competetions as a Technical Team(MindCloud) we used it during UGVC2018.
   - You will find Egyptian flag in the Camera and its just a placeholder picture instead of leaving that empty(to present the design to my team easily).
